              <p>But we're not just stopping at creating games. We want to you help you learn how to hack them too.</p>
              <p>
                All of us in the industry started somewhere. More often than not, that was hacking and modding games we loved to play as kids. Today, we have tools like Cheat Engine, as well as various other memory editors and hex editors, but the community isnâ€™t the same. And
                the barrier to entry is higher than ever. There arenâ€™t great tutorials or resources on hacking or modifying games anymore.
              </p>

              <p>
                We want to change that. We are creating a community for finding and sharing resources, whether itâ€™ s in the form of written tutorials, videos, or git repositories allowing modders and game hackers the ability to show off their work, in a safe and legal way. While
                at the same time, preserving the history that lead us here; showcasing everything from chat bots to game mods and everything in between.
              </p>

              <p>No matter what stage you are in you're career, whether you're just starting out, or a senior excutive at a large studio, everyone is here to learn, grow, and make connections!</p>
